# RainbowManip

Inspried by [this post on stack overflow](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/22144/images-with-all-colors), RainbowManip is a Java utility to generate images that contain every color. The results are often quite pretty. The strategy is simple. Add several points to the open list. Every iteration, choose one of the random colors and find the point on the open list whose neighbors match most closely with that color. Place the color in that point, remove the point from the list, and add all of its unvisited neighbors to the list. Repeat until all points are filled. The images below are generated by some variation on the rules, such as having multiple start points or filtering which points on the open list are considered.
